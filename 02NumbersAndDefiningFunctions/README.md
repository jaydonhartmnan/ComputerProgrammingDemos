1. `integer_calculator.py`

   Prompt the user twice: first to input the value of a number `x`, then for another number `y`. Then print the value of the sum of these two numbers.

   Then improve the code so it actually works mathematically.

   Then improve the readability code by nesting functions, in a similar way to chaining methods.

2. `decimal_calculator.py`

   Prompt the user for two numbers as before. However this time the numbers can be decimals. Print the sum of the two numbers.

   Then extend the code so that it round the answer to the nearest integer.

   Then extend the code so that it round the answer to 3 decimal places.

3. `print_banner_demo.py`

   Write a function `print_banner` that takes as input a message, and prints that message in the banner format from the previous assignment. Use it multiple times, then demonstrate changing the banner to use, e.g. asterisks.
