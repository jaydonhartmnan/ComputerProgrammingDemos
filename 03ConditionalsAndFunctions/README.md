1. `flex_friday.py`

    To leave early on a flex friday, you must have no "D" or "F" grades, and no tardies for the week. Write a program that prompts the user twice: once for a letter grade, and once for a number of tardies. It should then indicate whether or not the student is eligible for early release.

1. `returning_functions.py` - `is_valid_sat_score`

    Write a function called `is_valid_sat_score` that takes one integer as an input, and returns either `True` if the input is a valid SAT score, and `False` if it's not. SATs scores are between 200 and 800 inclusive (they also have to be multiples of 10, but never mind that for now).

    In the file, demonstrate the function several times in a human readable way.

1. `returning_functions.py` - `is_pythagorean_triple`

    Write a function called `is_pythagorean_triple` that takes three integers as inputs, and returns `True` if they are a Pythagorean triple (satisfies a^2 + b^2 = c^2), and `False` otherwise. Note that the three integers provided as input may be in any order.
