1. `flex_friday.py`

    some user input thing with if / elif / else. Maybe they type in a grade and number of tardies, and they're told whether they're allowed to leave or not during Friday flex time. Although that doesn't really use elif...

1. `returning_functions.py` - `is_valid_sat_score`

    Write a function called `is_valid_sat_score` that takes one integer as an input, and returns either `True` if the input is a valid SAT score, and `False` if it's not. SATs scores are between 200 and 800 inclusive (they also have to be multiples of 10, but never mind that for now).

    In the file, demonstrate the function several times in a human readable way.
