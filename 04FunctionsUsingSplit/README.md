1. `hms_to_seconds.py`

    Write a function `hms_to_seconds` that takes one argument: a string in "hms" format. That is, it shows a number of hours, minutes, and seconds. For example "02:30:00" represents two and a half hours. Your function should return the number of seconds in that time interval. For example, two and a half hours is 2 * 60 * 60 + 30 * 60 = 90000 s.
